Phew, finally after such a long time. Although the idea was to setup around June, coz I had the content for the [next blog]() ready and wanted to put it up but as usual laziness :S (its an ApexDC++ emoticon :-p). Then a couple of months passed until [Tet](https://pranaydeep-af.github.io/) also wanted to setup a blog and start writing some stuff and suggested we do it together. I was like 'Yess, sure!'. So I went ahead and setup this [template repo](https://github.com/skrish13/template-sites) as well, coz had seen few people's personal repos through time which i liked, mostly liked the minimal simplistic themes. But then again procrastinated for couple of weeks because I was a little busy (not justified though lol). Then forgot about it completely, then after few days started some work on a side project which would require a blog :P (more on that later) so here I am.

So back in June, when I wanted to setup blog and everything, there was obviously the main content which is Deep Learning, Multimodal Learning, Tech stuff etc. But I had also other 'life' stuff which I wanted to write about but didn't really want it to be a personal blog per se, so was thinking on it and organizing what all to write, still not sure let's see.
