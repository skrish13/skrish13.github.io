#### AOTW

This mostly will contain concept albums and normal albums of new artists or new music whose discographies I haven't heard yet. Won't contain any albums of some of the artists whose discogs I'm extremely familiar with - Dream Theater <3, LTE <3, Pain of Salvation, Tool, Porcupine Tree, Opeth, famous works of Yes, Genesis, Rush, Pink Floyd, KC, Katatonia, Haken. The idea is to explore the breadth of prog; maybe other genres at some point later on, and to not get stuck listening to the same music (there was a phase before I started listening to prog rock, mostly just listened to metal + prog metal)
