#### AOTW

This mostly will contain concept albums and normal albums of new artists or new music whose discographies I haven't heard yet. Won't contain any albums of some of the artists whose discogs I'm extremely familiar with - Dream Theater <3, LTE <3, Pain of Salvation, Tool, Porcupine Tree, Opeth, famous works of Yes, Genesis, Rush, Pink Floyd, KC, Katatonia, Haken. The idea is to explore the breadth of prog; maybe other genres at some point later on, and to not get stuck listening to the same music (there was a phase before I started listening to prog rock, mostly just listened to metal + prog metal)

#### Interested artists

In upcoming months, mostly works from these artists will be here. Please tell me (comments,mail,twitter) if any other related/interesting artists/albums, esp prog metal! :D. PS:The genre categorization is just a simple one, put up to help unaware people, dont take it seriously :P.

[Prog Rock] Anathema, Steven Wilson, Riverside, Blackfield, The Pineapple Thief, Slice The Cake, Guilt Machine, Thank You Scientist, Katatonia, Devin Townsend, Soen and the 70s Prog Rock - ELP, Gentle Giant, Camel, Van Der Graad and unexplored works of KC, Yes and Genesis. Gazpacho, Flying Colors.
[Prog Metal] Ayreon, Pagan's Mind,  BTBAM, Fates Warning, Leprous, Animals as Leaders, Cynic, Symphony X, Gojira, Marillion, OSI, Vanden Plas, Darkwater, Brutai, Dark Suns, TesseracT, Acrania, Versailles, Periphery, North Atlantic Oscillation, Earthside, Dillinger Escape Plan, Threshold, Sons of Apollo.
