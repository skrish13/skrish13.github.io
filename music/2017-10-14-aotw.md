#### AOTW

This mostly will contain concept albums and normal albums of new artists or new music whose discographies I haven't heard yet. Won't contain any albums of some of the artists whose discogs I'm extremely familiar with - Dream Theater <3, LTE <3, Pain of Salvation, Tool, Porcupine Tree, Opeth, few famous works of Yes, Genesis, Rush, KC, Katatonia, Haken. The idea is to explore the breadth of prog; maybe other genres at some point later on, and to not get stuck listening to the same music (there was a phase before I started listening to prog rock, mostly just listened to metal + prog metal)

#### Interested artists

In upcoming months, mostly works from these artists will be here. Please tell me (comments,mail,twitter) if any other related/interesting artists/albums, esp prog metal! :D

Ayreon, Anathema, Pagan's Mind, Steven Wilson, Riverside, Earthside, The Pineapple Thief, BTBAM, North Atlantic Oscillation, Slice The Cake, Gojira, Marillion, OSI, Vanden Plas, Guilt Machine, Acrania, Versailles, Dark Suns, Periphery, Thank You Scientist, Katatonia, Fates Warning, Blackfield, TesseracT, Devin Townsend, Soen, Leprous, Darkwater, Brutai and the 70s Prog Rock - ELP, Gentle Giant, Camel, Van Der Graad and unexplored works of KC, Yes and Genesis.
