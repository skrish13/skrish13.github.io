I mostly listen to progressive music (Prog Rock, Prog Metal to be specific) and heavy metal. If you have any amazing album/song suggestions, hit me up (mail/twitter).

I use Spotify, you can find lot of related playlists on my profile over [there](https://open.spotify.com/user/skrish18). We (me and [Tet](https://pranaydeep-af.github.io/)) try to have a SOTD (playlists are up on Spotify) every other day and an AOTW every week. More on AOTW [here](/music/aotw/).
