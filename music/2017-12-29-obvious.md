Well, I call these obvious ones because they're just too good and since the idea of AOTWs was to listen to new music, many great great albums won't come there. So I couldn't control myself to not list down one's that I do love. Broadly seperating them as Prog Metal and Prog Rock, please take with pinch of salt. Order is of no significance.
