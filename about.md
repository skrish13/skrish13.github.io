I'm primarily a DL engineering/research person @[Paralleldots](www.paralleldots.xyz). Mostly work on vision and medical imaging problems. Very much interested in [Multimodal ML](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09406) as well. Recent fascination in exploring inter-disciplinary works of CogSci and DL.

Will add more stuff here later/when feel like :P. If want to get in touch or collaborate please mail me or tweet at me (thanks).
