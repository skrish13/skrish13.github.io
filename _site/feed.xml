        <title>Blog is up</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ll keep this short. The last time I tried this (almost putting up the blog) was 2 months ago and ended up procrastinating royally. Had tried to put it along with a couple of posts but was getting stuck at some point and taking lite (read ‘giving up’ :P). So, just this post for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so the blog is up. A small background info post will follow soon. Mostly going to keep it Machine Learning (read Deep Learning :P) related Research and Engineering (Systems) posts only. Although would like to write about general “blogging” and “life” topics, but mostly No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adios.&lt;/p&gt;
